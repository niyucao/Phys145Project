# Phys145Project
Hello peeps here's the github repository for our project!!

I've added two example files showing how I did our most recent project. I think it would be most useful to start based off of what one of us already has, since our analysis is quite similar to what we've already been up to! We can ofc choose to use someone else's code - I'm for whatever we prefer as a group. :)

I use a package called awkward, which deals with arrays really nicely and also lets us work with jagged arrays suuuuper easily if we ever need to! Despite needing maybe 30min-1hr to get used it, I think it's a total game changer! Lmk what y'all think!

Here's the documentation on the package, which is super useful. Control F is our friend!
